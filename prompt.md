# Malos Christmas Website

You are buildling a beautiful site that uniquely displays the data for our Malos Family Christmas 'Guess gifts under Tree'

You have a gifts_count.csv file that contains how many gifts each person is bringing to the family gathering.
You have a guess_counts.csv file that contains how the guess of each person on how many gifts are under the tree. 

gifts = cards + gifts 

The site should include beautiful data visualizations and deep details about the gifts

The winner is closest without going over unless everyone goes over then the closest wins. 

This site will be hosted on netlify so take advantage of that if neccessary.
